This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) group project that aims to develop an automatic spell checker and correction system for detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors, based on Astrological texts domain. The detection of non- and real-word errors will be differentiated using different colour highlights (red = non-word error; yellow = real-word error), followed by generating a list of suitable candidate replacement words based on their likelihood ranking.
